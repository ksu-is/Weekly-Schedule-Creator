# Weekly-Schedule-Creator
A program that allows you to type in what you would like your daily schedule to look per week, Sunday through Saturday, however way you would like! 

How this program will work is that it will go down each day of the week and let you type in whatever you need or would like to have done for that day. This could be useful for both students and professionals alike who would like a unique and fun way on organizing their schedule!
